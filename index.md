Founded in 1996, The Chai Notes is Cornell University's best and only Jewish themed, co-ed a Cappella group. We sing both Hebrew and English songs, including current popular hits. Overall, as a tight-knit group, we love to sing and perform together.

Our repertoire includes songs such as Run Away With Me by Carly Rae Jepsen, Et Rikod by Yaakov Shwekey, and Jealous by Chromeo.

Our concert dates and times are posted on the <a href="/concerts/">Concerts</a> page of the site. If you are interested in having us perform for your event on campus or in your community elsewhere, please send us an email through the <a href="/contact/">Contact</a> page. And, if you are a current Cornellian who loves to sing, we hold auditions every semester â€” you don't have to be Jewish to audition! For more information and frequently asked questions, be sure to take a look at the <a href="/auditions/">Auditions</a> page.
