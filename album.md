The Chai Notes have been Cornell's best and only Jewish a cappella group since 1996.  Since our founding season two decades ago&#44; our songs and singers have changed&#44; but our loves of music&#44; Judaism&#44; and fun have remained constant.  This album&#44; our first in over eight years&#44; highlights these three values complemented by the quality and professionalism that we've worked hard to achieve.  We hope you enjoy Best &amp; Only&#44; and share our music with your friends and family! Now available for only &#36;10!
