  <h6>Our super simple audition process:</h6>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h6>Vocal Exercises</h6>
      <p>
        First, we will ask you to sing some scales so we can hear what range you sing in.  Next, we will have you do some sort of pitch exercise.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h6>Short Solo</h6>
      <p>
        We will then ask you to perform a short solo, usually just a verse and a chorus, that shows off your talent.  Just a tip -- try to pick a song in your most comfortable range.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h6>Callbacks</h6>
      <p>
        We will then notify you to ask you to a callback.  Callbacks are basically a mock rehearsal session to see how you interact with the group and how fast you can learn a song that we will teach you.    There is really no way to prepare for the callback.  Just make sure that you are in good health, relaxed, and ready to sing!

  <h5>FAQs</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="q">Q: Do I have to be Jewish to audition?</span>
      <span class="a">A: You do not have to be Jewish to audition. Anyone and everyone is invited to audition. </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="q">Q: Do I need to have prior singing experience?</span>
      <span class="a">A: You don't need to have any experience. We have had people in our group who never performed outside the shower before joining.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="q">Q: What if I can't read music?</span>
      <span class="a">A: Have no fear! As long as you have an ear for music, you can definitely sing in an A Cappella group. We have had members in our group with little to no musical background who have really loved the learning experience that comes with being in an A Cappella group.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="q">Q: What's the time commitment?</span>
      <span class="a">A: We usually rehearse for 2 hours three times a week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. About a week before concerts, we usually have to dedicate a little more time to rehearsing.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="q">Q: How can I serve on the Executive Board of the group?</span>
      <span class="a">A: During the spring semester, we hold elections for the upcoming academic year. Knowing the incoming E-board helps us ease the leadership transition each year.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="q">Q: Do you sing in Hebrew? What if I cannot speak or understand a word of Hebrew?</span>
      <span class="a">A: We do sing some songs in Hebrew. Believe it or not, most Hebrew songs are easy to learn, even with no background in the language. We have had many members who joined the group with no knowledge of the language whatsoever and found learning Hebrew songs easy, fun and exciting. Both Cornell's Glee Club and Chorus sing in Latin and Russian on occasion — there is really no difference.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="q">Q: How would you describe your repertoire?</span>
      <span class="a">A: We sing some modern popular hits, some oldies, pop Israeli music and classical Jewish songs in Hebrew. Check out our videos to listen to some of our current arrangements. </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="q">Q: Can I audition for more than one A Cappella group? How does that work?</span>
      <span class="a">A: Absolutely! Through Cornell's student-run A Cappella Advisory Council (<a href="http://cornellacac.tumblr.com/">ACAC</a>), A Cappella groups at Cornell work together to sort out time conflicts for students who have auditioned for more than one group. </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="q">Q: "Chai" — as in the tea? How do you pronounce the name of your group?</span>
      <span class="a">A: "Chai" means "life" in Hebrew. It is a prominent symbol in modern Judaism. You can read about that <a href="http://judaism.about.com/od/judaismbasics/g/chai.htm">here</a>. In terms of pronouncing the word, it is pronounced like the English word "hi" — hence the pun to our group's name. You can also listen to how it should be pronounced:</span>
