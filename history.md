    In the fall of 1996, on the first night of Sukkot— the Feast of Tabernacles — Rebecca Schaefer met Shira Klapper for the first time. During that introductory meeting, Shira proposed her grand plan to create a Jewish a Cappella group at Cornell and asked if Rebecca would be interested in joining this endeavor. Currently a professor of music, Rebecca agreed and became the first Musical Director of The Chai Notes, Cornell University’s Co-ed Jewish A Cappella Group.

    Since then, this group has taken the Cornell community by storm, bringing together people of all backgrounds to appreciate the Jewish musical tradition. The Chai Notes have performed at everything from synagogue celebrations to Holocaust memorial concerts to multicultural performing arts festivals and have produced four studio albums. The Chai Notes can be found singing at local gigs, national tours, or around campus just for fun!

  <h4>About our founding Musical Director</h4>
  <img src="/img/history/rebecca-cypress.jpg" alt="Rebecca Cypress">
  <p>
    Dr. Rebecca Cypess, n&eacute;e Schaefer, joined the Rutgers faculty in the fall of 2012, having served as a faculty member in musicology at the New England Conservatory for four years. She has also taught in the Department of Music at Yale University, at the Yale School of Music, and at Southern Connecticut State University.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cypess earned her Ph.D. in music history from Yale in 2008, where, under the supervision of Ellen Rosand, she wrote a dissertation exploring connections between vocal and instrumental music in early 17th-century Italy. She holds an M.A. and an M.Phil. from Yale, as well as an M.A. in Jewish Studies from Yeshiva University and an M.Mus. in harpsichord performance from the Royal College of Music (London). As an undergraduate at Cornell University, she studied modern and early pianos with Malcolm Bilson, and musicology with James Webster, Neal Zaslaw, and Rebecca Harris-Warrick.
  </p>
  <p>
    In her teaching Cypess focuses primarily on music in 17th- and 18th-century Europe, with attention to the interaction between music and larger cultural and artistic trends. Her teaching methods are designed with the goal of helping students find their own voices, so that they can ask questions about music and learn to develop and articulate their own answers. She has a strong interest in issues of performance practice, and she enjoys teaching in ways that encourage students to combine musicology and performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cypess publishes regularly in scholarly journals, with articles, essays, and reviews in <i>The Journal of Musicology</i>, <i>Early Music</i>, <i>The Musical Quarterly</i>, the <i>Journal of the American Musicological Society</i>, <i>Early Music America</i>, and elsewhere; and she has also been commissioned to write a series of entries for Encyclopedia Britannica on early modern women in music. She has presented papers at national meetings of the American Musicological Society, the Renaissance Society of America, the American Musical Instrument Society, and the Society for Seventeenth-Century Music. For the SSCM she is chair of the 2013 program committee, and she serves as webmaster for the AMS study group on Jewish Studies and Music. She is currently in her second term as a member of the AMS Committee on Career-Related Issues, for which she has organized the "Conference Buddy Program" as well as panels on work/life balance.
  </p>
  <p>
    With Beth L. Glixon and Nathan Link, Cypess is co-editor of <i>Word, Image, and Song</i>, a two-volume collection of essays forthcoming from the University of Rochester Press. Her own book project, now in progress, is entitled "'Curious and Modern Inventions': Humanism and the Mechanics of Italian Instrumental Music, 1610–1630"; in it she argues that the flowering of the stile moderno instrumental repertoire may be attributable to the late-Renaissance fascination with machinery -- with artistic and scientific instruments of all kinds that served as mediators between people and the world around them.
